## Setting up the code
Given the size of the marine debris classifier project, only the files modified by the team are included in this submission.
To use the code, please download Mr. Marc Russwurn's repository (https://gitlab.epfl.ch/russwurm/marinedebris-classifier) and replace the following files:
1 - "tranforms.py"
2 - "checkpoints" (folder)
3 - "model" (folder)

Add the "marinedebris_refined" dataset (https://drive.google.com/file/d/14mWD8jwpzQYKwHlmD5c6JrKpj1pmE_NH/view?usp=sharing) to the "data" folder


## Testing
Once the files are included, launch the executable_testing.ipynb from the project's main folder. Some results should already be displayed at the bottom on the page.
